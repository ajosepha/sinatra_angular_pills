sinatra_angular_pills
=====================

This is an app that leverages the Angular search features to make information about Birth Control pills easily accessible. The app was born out of my difficulty while living abroad to find equivalents to the hormones I was taking, and a desire to know more about the hormones that women put in their bodies every day.

The app uses data from the National Institute of Health, which is parsed using Nokogiri.  It then persists this data into a database.

The data is bound using Angular's data-binding feature.  There is also JQuery to hide and show the birth control pills by hormone or by name.

Going forward, I intend to expand the app to include information on diffent types of hormonal birth control and internationalize it.  Any other suggestions are of course welcome as well!
